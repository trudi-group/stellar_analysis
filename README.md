## Running on a local Web Server

[![CI](https://github.com/wiberlin/stellar_analysis/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wiberlin/stellar_analysis/actions/workflows/test.yml)

In this section we show how to run this tool using a local web server.

1. Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
	- This requires a `Rustup` installation which can be downloaded [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Build the sources in the project's root directory: 

```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

3. Start a local HTTP server of your choice such as Python3's http.server:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Alternatively, the analyses may be performed on our server which can be found [here](https://trudi.weizenbaum-institut.de/stellar_analysis.html).

## Deployment to a Web Server

This section covers how this tool can be deployed to your web server instead.

1. Build the sources as shown above (item 1 & 2).
2. Copy the following files to the location of your web server's filesystem maintaining the directory structure:

	- `index.html`
	- `data_handler.js`
	- `graph.js`
	- `layout.css`
	- `util.js`
	- `pkg/stellar_analysis_bg.wasm`
	- `pkg/stellar_analysis.js`

	The rest of the files do not need to be copied to your web server.

3. Depending on your web server, you can now serve the page on your server.

## Package managers

- This tool is also now available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stellar_analysis) and can be installed using

	`npm i stellar_analysis`

The analyses performed here are powered by the [fbas_analyzer](https://github.com/wiberlin/fbas_analyzer) tool/library.

## Running tests

For Rust parts: `wasm-pack test --node`
